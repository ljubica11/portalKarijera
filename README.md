## General info
Purpose of this project was to make a website that would allow certified attendees of IT retraining program to register, make a profile and get in touch with companies that are looking to recruit new talents, as well as with other students. It also allows companies to register and post job ads, send announcements, post news, browse registered students by multiple criteria, make groups of students or start discussions with them on different topics (like a forum). Website allows administrators to collect, process and send data about registered users. We have four types of users: guest, student, company and admin. 

## Technologies
* PHP
* Ajax
* JavaScript
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Codeigniter
* WampServer
* MySql 

## Setup
To see our project in action, please install [WampServer](http://www.wampserver.com/en/download-wampserver-64bits/) and make sure all services are running. 

Download this repo to the folder named "www", which you will find inside your Wamp folder. Please make sure the name of the project on your computer (inside "www") is "portalKarijera". Ok? Ok! We're almost done!

Next, you need to load the database (it's a file named karijera.sql in repo) which can easily be done in [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/). Open Workbench, click "file", then "Open SQL Script", and choose script "karijera.sql" from the repo you downloaded. Execute the script and that's it. 

You can also use phpMyAdmin, which comes with Wamp. Open it, go to "import", choose this script and click "go". 
Open the project in an IDE of your choice. We used [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org). You can run the project now.
