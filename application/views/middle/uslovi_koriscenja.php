SCOPE OF Data61’S SERVICE
The scope of Data61 Services is to provide and maintain the Ribit Platform and its inherent functionality as a service for Users. An employer who has a job that they need filled, or who needs a particular task performed is referred to as a “Job Poster”. A Students who is willing and qualified to do the job or perform the task is referred to as a “Student Worker”.
A reference to “User” in this agreement includes a Job Poster, a Student Worker and any other person that visits or views the Ribit Platform or relies upon the information collected within the Ribit Platform with the permission of Data61, whether they have registered on the Ribit Platform or not.
A User creates an account with Data61 when they validly complete a registration form on the Ribit Platform. Account details (including Your name and contact details) may be visible to other Users. It is intended that a Job Poster can see the account details of a Student Worker and a Student Worker can see the account details of a Job Poster. In general, it is not intended that:
A Job Poster can see account details of another Job Poster; and
A Student can see account details of another Student.
Apart from making available the account details of a Job Poster to a Student Worker, (which is the purpose of the Ribit Platform) Data61 accepts no liability for any aspect of the Users’ relationship or interaction, including but not limited to the terms upon which  the Users may decide to conduct their relationship. Data61 has no obligation to any User to assist or involve itself in any way in any dispute between them.
All information related to a job or a task to be performed or the qualifications or experience of a User is supplied by the User. Data61 does not have any ability or responsibility to pre-screen, review, approve or verify any information  provided on the Ribit Platform. If Data61 forms the opinion that dishonest, misleading or disputed information has been provided by a User, then it reserves the right to remove that information and to suspend or terminate a User’s account without notice.
You expressly agree that Data61 has no responsibility and makes no warranty to You as to the truth or accuracy of any information posted by a User on the Ribit Platform or in any other communications between Users. This includes any representations about:
the true identity of the User; or
the skills, ability or qualifications of a Student Worker; or
the work conditions associated with a job or task; or
a Job Poster’s ability to pay the Student Worker.
Data61 SERVICE: HOW IT WORKS
Data61’s Services may be reviewed and updated from time to time. In addition to the elements described below, certain portion(s) of the Data61 Service may be separately described on the Ribit Platform. The Data61 Service may change in the future.
A Job Poster creates an account with Data61 and posts an accurate and complete description of
the job or task;
the payment; and
other relevant terms offered to the Student Worker.
This is called the “Posted Opportunity”. Posted Opportunities are subject to further terms set out for Posting Tasks and Making Offers below.
A Student Worker creates an account with Data61 and reviews Posted Opportunities.
A Student Worker may make an offer in response to the Posted Opportunity (“Offer”). By making an Offer the Student Worker confirms that s/he is legally entitled to, and capable of supplying, the services described in the Posted Opportunity. Offers are subject to further terms set out for Posting Tasks and Making Offers below.
If the Job Poster accepts a Student Worker’s Offer, the Job Poster will signify their acceptance by using the functionality on the Ribit Platform.
Once a Job Poster has accepted an Offer then the Job Poster and the Student Worker will be deemed, as between each other,  to have entered into a separate contract (“Work Contract”) on the terms described in the Posted Opportunity and the Offer.
It will be material breach of this Agreement by the party in default if a party breaches the terms of their Work Contract.
A Job Poster may choose not to accept any Offer received. A Job Poster may withdraw any Posted Opportunity at any time prior to accepting an Offer.
A Student Worker has no obligation whatsoever to make an Offer in response to a Posted Opportunity.
Without limitation to any other term of this Agreement, Data61 reserves the right to add to, remove or modify any aspect, tool, or functionality of the Data61 Services (including the Ribit Platform) at any time without notice to Users and without compensation.
POSTING TASKS AND MAKING OFFERS
A Posted Opportunity must include all of the required details in order to be accepted by Data61 onto the Ribit Platform. Data61 reserves the right to remove or edit (in whole or in part) the details of any Posted Opportunity in whole or in part if it believes the required details are inadequate, incomprehensible or misleading in any way. If we make changes to a Posted Opportunity we will make reasonable efforts to notify the Job Poster if we believe that our changes are substantive.
You must have the legal right to use and post any content that You post as part of a Posted Opportunity or an Offer. Data61 may, in its sole discretion, remove any Posted Opportunity or Offer for any reason.
If a User wishes to complain about any content or comment appearing on the Ribit Platform, please contact Data61 using feedback link provided in clause 15.4. Data61 will not tolerate unacceptable content and may, in its sole and absolute discretion, remove any content at any time without notice to a User.
THIRD PARTY SERVICES
Data61 may from time to time include on the Ribit Platform promotions for and links to services offered by third parties (“Third Party Services”) which are not provided by Data61.
Third Party Services are offered to You pursuant to terms and conditions offered by the third party. Third Party Services may be promoted on the Ribit Platform for the convenience to our Users who may find the Third Party Services of interest or of use.
If You engage with any Third Party Service provider your agreement will be directly between You and that Third Party Service provider. Data61 does not require you to engage with or respond to any Third Party Service provider.
Data61 makes no representation or warranty as to the Third Party Services. To help us continue to improve our Ribit Platform, please let us know of any issue that You experience using a Third Party Service by contacting us at support@ribit.net.
Data61 reserves the right to add or to cease the availability of Third Party Services at any time, without notice to You.
IDENTITY VERIFICATION (AUTHENTICATION)
Data61 may include tools to help Users to verify the identity of other Users (“Identity Verification Services”). These tools may include mobile phone verification technology, Student Worker university email account verification, an  “Endorsement” feature (allowing a User to endorse the skills or abilities of a User on the Ribit Platform), and integration with social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
You agree that Identity Verification Services may not be fully accurate and may be unreliable because they are dependent on User-supplied information. If you rely upon the Identity Verification Services then that is entirely at Your own risk.
ELIGIBILITY TO REGISTER

You may not deal with your account (including feedback and associated User ID) in any way (including by allowing others to use your account or by transferring or selling the account or any of its content to another person).
